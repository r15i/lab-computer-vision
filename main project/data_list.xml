    <description>Provides 120 images divided into 4 classes as in the table
? Aerial imagery, the sky is less visible!
? Relatively easy, but small amount of data available, avoid overfitting!
? The data has been divided into 2/3 for training and 1/3 for testing

? Provides 1200 images divided into 4 classes as in the table
? Aerial imagery but bigger than UAVid
? Same classes as UAVid, you can test transfer by training on one and
test on the other
? Relatively easy, a good accuracy can be reached
? The data has been divided into 400 for test and 800 for training
